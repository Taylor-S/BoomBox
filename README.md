# BoomBox

Project made to test and improve my skills as a web developer.

This web app is an audio player with a skin which was designed using Inkscape and Gimp.

Jekyll static site builder was also utilized to speed-up workflow.

The audio player features simple functions such as play, pause, next track, previous track, increase/decrease volume and a seeking function (doesn't work well on codepen, but works perfectly on local system and most likely if uploaded to a server).

As skills increase, extra features and improvements will be added.

Peace,

Taylor
